This is the GaAs Monte-Carlo simulation code for explain JLab GaAs-GaAs superlattice photocathode photo sepectrum. WeiLiu modified the multialkali MC code. The following changes have been made:
1. Add more scattering
2. Include the surface barrier with surface potential
3. Using GaAs band structure.
